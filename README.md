# thinkful-local-library

This is a project from Thinkful that demostrates that I know how to use high order js functions.

## Notes

The UI was made by Thinkful and the project is for me to write the algorithms.

### Requirements

* All tests are passing in Qualified.
* The project doesn't include any single-letter variables.
* The project makes at least one use of an arrow function.
* The project makes at least one use of each of the following native array methods: find(), filter(), map(), and reduce().
* The project employs at least one helper function, which helps support the tested functions.
* The project uses at least two of the following JavaScript features: the ternary operator, the spread operator, object shorthand, array or object destructuring, and for/in loops.
